# Resources & Links

Sometimes we find stuff on the internet that we need every once in a while, or that we want to refer back to later. Here are links to those things.

* [How to check out a pull request locally (before you accept it)](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247) - I've found [this comment](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247#comment-580127) particularly helpful since I don't do this all the time.

* [Allocating Memory for Postgres on Mac OSX](http://support.bitrock.com/article/postgresql-cannot-allocate-memory-on-mac-os-x) Super helpful walkthrough on upping the memory postgres can use on your mac. I've (John) run into problems with my local db freaking out and dying because it runs out of memory or connections or something.
